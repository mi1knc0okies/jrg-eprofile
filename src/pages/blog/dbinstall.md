The ACME Corp. is working on adding a database to monitor all software used throughout the company on company provided systems. The database will log all software used on the computers. The data that will be available in the database is the type of software, the developer of the software, the version of the software, the type of licensing agreements needed for that software, the department that is allowed to use the software, what computer the software is installed on and when the software is installed. This paper will discuss the flow of the project from start to finish.
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">Initiation Phase</h1>
<p>
I Jesse Graham of Graham Inc., will create a proposal to ACME Corp. detailing what services I will provide through the installation of the database. This will include a plan of how to implement the database, estimated man hours needed, testing needed before going live with the database, and finally, an estimated completion date. Upon approval we move to the definition phase.  
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">
Definition Phase
</h1>
<p>
Within the definition phase we will define the specifications of the database needed by ACME Corp. most important thing to be defined is the database management system or DBMS. From there we will define the database tables and columns needed to meet the needs of ACME Corp. Discussion of any access to the premises and or equipment that will be needed. The access can be remote as well. Determining if ACME has the resources needed to complete the task or if new servers will be required. Determine if the servers will be on site or will they be remote servers or cloud-based database. These are some of the discussions that will be needed during the definition phase.
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">
Design Phase
</h1>
<p>
Once the scope of the project has been defined in the definition phase, we can start designing the flow of database. Will the database need multiple tables to meet the requirements. Designating the primary keys within the database and if any foreign key relations will need to be created. Engineers will be assigned their responsibilities and task to be completed. Upon agreement with ACME Corp., we will move on to the next phase.
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">
Development Phase
</h1>
<p>
During the development phase, engineers will create a test database that meets the requirements of ACME Corp. Access will be given to their engineers for testing and test data will be populated in the needed fields. Using CPM or critical path method a schedule will be made and confirmed with ACME Corp. Redundancies with staff will be created in case an engineer is unable to complete their task with other engineers pulled in to assist as needed.
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">
Implementation Phase
</h1>
<p>
Access to the test database will be given to ACME Corp. IT staff for testing and test data will be populated in the needed fields. Connections will be tested to the computers and equipment needed to access the database. Once testing has been completed and ACME Corp has determined if any changes need to be done, a go live date can be determined. The production database will be put into place and again connections for ACME Corp staff will be tested. Once ready the database will go live with engineers on staff to handle any issue that may arise. Once everything is working as intended and the database is populating data as it should the implementation phase is complete.
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">Follow-up Phase
</h1>
<p>
During the follow-up phase the engineering team will ensure that the database is working as intended. Confirmation with ACME Corp that things are working as they would like will be completed. Documentation for database access will be provided to ACME Corp.
</p>
<h1 class="text-xl">Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
With the limited information provided about this project, this is a high overview of what would be needed to complete the task. Project management is a very intricate task with many requirements. There are many critical phases from defining the scope of the project then to actual implementation and lastly the follow-up phase ensuring that the stakeholders are happy, and the project is completed. This is only possible if ACME Corp and Graham INC. work together and with complete transparency on the necessary actions and tools required to complete the task.
